### The author
Vincent Martel is a software developer / telecommunications technician / bachelor in computer engineering who is wildly interested in connecting various things (networking, servers, micro-controllers), making them communicate with each other (software development, protocols, APIs) while making them useful for us, humans (science, business intelligence, logistics, leisure, etc.)

Otherwise, he is also really interested in arts (photography, music, video, design), sports (snowboarding, hockey, ultimate frisbee, biking, running, outdoors, etc.), culture (travelling, languages), and life in its general form!

### This site
This site, which is an experiment on its own, was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} and is running a slightly modified version of [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll){:target="_blank"}. All the code is managed using Git and is served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com){:target="_blank"}. Kinda awesome if you ask me!

[//]: <> Being used to work with the [WordPress](https://wordpress.com){:target="_blank"} ecosystem, the first goal of this experiment was to get to know this platform better. The publishing workflow will be a bit different, but it seems really straight forward.
